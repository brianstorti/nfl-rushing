# NFL Rushing

This is a standard Rails application using a PostgreSQL database.

Assuming you have `ruby` (2.7.2), `yarn` and `postgres` installed, run the setup
script to install the dependencies, prepare the database and import the seed
data:

```
$ bin/setup
```

And then you can start the Rails server:

```
$ bin/rails server
```

And access it on http://localhost:3000.

Run the tests with:

```
$ bin/rails test
```

Alternatively, you can access it live [here](https://nfl-brian.herokuapp.com).
